# Decentralized-Sparse-Gaussian-Process-Regression-with-Compressed-Feedback-for-Multi-robot-Systems


The source code, datasets, and videos for the paper ''Decentralized Sparse Gaussian Process Regression with Compressed Feedback for Multi-robot Systems'' (submitted to CDC 2023).


'MainForField.m' and 'MainForKin40' are the main MATLAB files for the two cases on simulations.

The implements of the hyper-parameters optimization 'hyp_opt.m', 'neglog_marginallikelihood.m' and Gaussian kernel 'kRBF.m' refer to https://github.com/Hrusikesha/Parsimonious-Online-Gaussian-Process
